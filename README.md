Is it New Year's?

A website that let you know whether it is New Year or not. Oh well, just in case your cat ripped your calender and you live in a forest with a device that can access to a website (?!?) 🤷‍♀️ I mean... anything could happen, right? So here we are!

This web application is built with the help of Python (ssssssss 🐍), Django framework 🤠, Visual Studio Code, and their packages (thank God)!

How to use:

Very simple! within 5-10 seconds (depends on your typing skill) of your time, you will find out immediately if it's currently new year's or not by typing the url: isitNewYear.***
The result should be as follows:
